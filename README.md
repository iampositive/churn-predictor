# churn-predictor
Machine Learning model for predicting customer churn using Python. The project leverages the Telecom Customer Churn dataset, employing Pandas for data preprocessing and Scikit-learn for modeling and evaluation. The goal is to predict whether a customer will churn based on various features, achieving an accuracy of X%.


We'll follow the steps below:

Import necessary libraries
Load and explore the dataset
Data preprocessing (handle missing values, encode categorical variables, etc.)
Split the data into training and test sets
Build a model using Scikit-learn (e.g., Logistic Regression)
Evaluate the model's accuracy
